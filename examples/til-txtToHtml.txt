This week was an exciting adventure in overcoming inertia.  While a good refresher for some workflow and debugging practices, I got a harsh reminder of what it takes to switch gears and refocus on new priorities. 
Tasked with building a command line text to html conversion tool, I chose to write my program for Python, as I find it to be an easy and efficient approach to writing CLI tools. Particularly when considering sharing the finished application with others, it is a relatively simple process to outline install and application instructions for Python programs.
What I developed is ezTxt2Html, a simple open-source Python program that converts plain text (.txt) into HTML files (.html).  It can be used to convert individual files or all files in a directory. It’s easy to install with the following these steps:
1. Ensure you have the latest version of Python 3 installed.

`python --version`

2. If needed, download and install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Clone or download my repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt/ez-txt2html.git`

4. Change your current working directory to the src directory within the project folder:

`cd ez-txt2html\src`

5. Install the required dependencies by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

That’s it, ez, the program is ready to run.

You can run the program from the command line. It accepts the following command-line arguments:

- '-h' or '--help': Display help screen.
- '-v' or '--version': Display the current version of ezTxtToHtml and exit.
- 'inputPath' (required): Provide the path to the target file or directory containing the files to be converted.

To can run ezTxtToHtml use the command `python ezTxtToHtml.py inputPath` from the ./src/ directory in repository. Replace 'inputPath':  this with the path to the target file or directory containing text or markdown files. For example:

1. Convert a single text or markdown file to HTML:

`python ezTxtToHtml.py path/to/yourfile.txt`

2. Convert all text or markdown files in a directory to HTML:

`python ezTxtToHtml.py path/to/yourdirectory`

## Output

HTML files will be saved to an automatically generated./src/HTML/ directory. This folder will be overwritten entirely with each execution of the program.
HTML files will have the same name as the input files but with the .html extension.

## Examples 
The included examples folder contains a sample text file which can be run to get an idea of this tool works.  While in the src folder run:

`python ezTxtToHtml.py ../examples/` to see how it convert all text files in a folder, OR 

`python ezTxtToHtml.py ../examples/blogPost.txt` to see how it converts a single specified file.

The converted HTML files will appear in /src/HTML/ unless otherwise specified.

## Version

The current version of ezTxtToHtml is 0.1.
